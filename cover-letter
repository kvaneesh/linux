mm/debug_vm_pgtable fixes

This patch series includes fixes for debug_vm_pgtable test code so that
they follow page table updates rules correctly. The first two patches introduce
changes w.r.t ppc64. The patches are included in this series for completeness. We can
merge them via ppc64 tree if required.

Hugetlb test is disabled on ppc64 because that needs larger change to satisfy
page table update rules.

Changes from v2:
* Fix build failure with different configs and architecture.

Changes from v1:
* Address review feedback
* drop test specific pfn_pte and pfn_pmd.
* Update ppc64 page table helper to add _PAGE_PTE
